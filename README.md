A simple dashboard for CloudFormation stack metrics from CloudWatch.

This is the bare concept of a project to use the [AWS JavaScript SDK](http://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-browser/) to develop a purely-client-side CloudWatch graph tool. Sure, it's not terribly performant, but the idea is to (A) allow graphing of CloudWatch metrics for CloudFormation stacks with no changes to central infrastructure, by anyone with API access, and (B) allow this to be customized by end-users with HTML/JavaScript skills.
